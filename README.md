# Phone_Response_Automation

The goal of this script is to make a simple comparison script that can run automated at a time specified. The idea is to have an output CSV that contains the Household ID and the Most Recent Date of a Voicemail successfully reaching the contact's Answering machine. And then once that works I want it to run as an automated script.
